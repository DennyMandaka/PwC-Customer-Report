# PwC Switzerland Customer Report
## Project Objective
This project is part of a Job Simulation Program by PwC Switzerland, designed to simulate real-world business scenarios. It provided an opportunity to analyze customer data, derive actionable insights, and create an interactive Power BI dashboard. By focusing on customer segmentation, loyalty metrics, and key performance indicators (KPIs), this simulation helped me enhance my data analysis, problem-solving, and visualization skills, mirroring the requirements of professional roles in business intelligence and analytics. 

## Approach and Execution
Step 1: Data Preparation
- Ensured consistent formatting for dates, text strings, and numeric values to standardize the dataset.
- Checked for duplicates in the dataset and removed redundant entries.
- Performed text cleaning using Excel functions such as PROPER and IF to standardize names and other string fields.
- Left blanks in specific columns (e.g., missing tenure data) to indicate "no data available" rather than imputing values.

Step 2: Data Transformation
- Added a "Loyalty" column to categorize customers based on their tenure using the IFS function, facilitating customer segmentation.
- Transformed data in Power Query, ensuring proper data types for columns such as dates, numeric fields, and text.
- Developed calculated columns and DAX measures to calculate KPIs such as Average Purchase Frequency, Customer Churn Rate, Services Subscribed by Customers, etc. Key DAX functions included AVERAGEX, DIVIDE, DISTINCTCOUNT, COUNTROWS, and FILTER.

Step 3: Visualization and Dashboard Creation
- Designed interactive dashboards in Power BI to visualize key metrics.
- Included Slicers to allow filtering by tenure, loyalty categories, and demographics for enhanced user interactivity.
- Used intuitive charts and visuals to communicate insights effectively, ensuring the dashboard was accessible and actionable for stakeholders.
- The interactive report pages in Power BI appear as shown <a href="https://github.com/DennyMandaka/PwC-Switzerland-Customer-Report/blob/main/PwC%20Customer%20Report.png">here</a>. The complete Power BI file can be accessed <a href="https://github.com/DennyMandaka/PwC-Switzerland-Customer-Report/blob/main/PwC%20Customer%20Report.pbix">here</a>.

## Insights and Conclusion
- This project enhanced my ability to analyze customer behavior and derive meaningful insights from loyalty metrics and KPIs.
- It deepened my understanding of how customer segmentation can inform targeted marketing strategies and operational decisions.
- Hands-on experience with real-world datasets improved my technical skills in Power BI, DAX, and data transformation.
